## Something is very wrong with my map, my templates are screwed up, my changes aren't saving
Double-check that you have set your VoxelWorld save file to your tile's _save file and not the template.  Double-check that you don't have the template edit layer in your levels.
## When I place the tile the preview is blank, a different tile, or a placeholder
Make sure your preview image in Content\UI\Textures\DiXingYuLan is named the same as your tile.
## I painted over the blending surfaces on the edge of the map
You can select them from the voxel surface types and draw them however you want - the template is for convenience, although you should make sure that all edges are covered and flat.
